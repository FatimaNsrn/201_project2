# 🤖 Farsi NLP Sequence Tagging Project: Model Comparison

This project explores and compares several pivotal models—from classical statistics to modern Transformers—for two core Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Farsi/Persian language.

### 🚀 Final Performance Summary

The experiments demonstrate a clear progression in performance, with deep learning and Transformer models significantly surpassing traditional statistical baselines, especially for the complex NER task.

### 🛠️ Setup and Dependencies

The project is structured across multiple notebooks, generally requiring Python 3.8+ and GPU access (e.g., Google Colab or local environment) for the deep learning models.

#### 🔬 Model Deep Dive

1. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
The goal is to assign the correct grammatical tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective, etc.) to each word in the Farsi text.

### 2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

The goal is to locate and classify named entities (Person, Location, Organization, etc.) in the Farsi text.
